        &emsp; My name is Joshua Lee! I am a third year transfer student and computer science major 
        at Santa Clara University. I previosly attended Loyola Marymount University. I am from Fremont,
        California, so staying local to the Bay Area! I am fluent in Java, Python, C, C++, HTML, 
        Javascript, CSS, and Swift. I have vast experience coding web apps and IOS mobile apps.

        &emsp; Outside of programming, I enjoy watching sports such as football and basketball! My
        favorite teams are the San Francisco 49ers, Las Vegas Raiders, and the Golden State Warriors!
        Essentially, the bay area sports teams. 
        I have been doing fantasy football for the past two years and just won my league this year!
        It took a lot of time and some luck, but was really fun! I also enjoy playing video games 
        and reading historical biographies.

        &emsp; I am looking to improve my programming skills with hands-on experience by working in
        real working conditions with other people. I want to prepare for the real world by working
        on projects from the tech industry.
